# Ecommerce Scraper Application

Have you ever needed to go through multiple e-commerce websites simultaneously to check the price of the same product? Prices can differ but having a list side by side would be a bonus, wouldn't it?

Reviews can be confusing too, one product has 5 stars with only 10 reviews whereas another product of the same kind has fewer stars but more reviews. Which one shall you spend on?

This application can do them both. Show listings from Amazon and Flipkart side by side and show a word cloud representation of the reviews.
